# TriviaApp

This is the simple quiz app which consist of three parts frontend, api and microservice which collect statistics.

Client part was written in typescript with angular.
Api part was written in python with django. As the database I used postgresql.
Microservice part was written in python with fastapi. As the database I used redis.

For communicating between api and microservice I used kafka.

App was dockerized. All the settings of containers liez in the docker-compose.yml and dockerfiles.
